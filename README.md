# fractal_generation
Two varieties of fractals are generated in this repository.

First we have the Dragon Fractal. This is the shape generated by a thin strip of paper if you were to fold it in half repeatedly, and then unfold all of your folds to 90 degree angles. My inspiration to pursue this project came when I was playing with a straw wrapper at a restaurant.
